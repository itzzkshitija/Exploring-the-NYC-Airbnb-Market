# Analyzing the Airbnb NYC 2019 Market üè®
# Introduction üìç
Airbnb is an online marketplace connecting people who want to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations in that locale. It currently covers more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries worldwide. For hosts, it's a way to earn money while protecting their property from potential damage. However, for guests, it's a risky venture that they should avoid.

For this project, we are analyzing Airbnb‚Äôs New York City(NYC) data for 2019. NYC is not only the most famous city in the world but also a top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants, and commerce. According to the Office of New York State Comptroller, NYC hosted 66.6 million visitors in 2019.

Data analysis on thousands of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. Our main objective is to find out the key metrics influencing the listing of properties on the platform. For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We have found out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors. We have analyzed this dataset from different angles and developed interesting insights. This can help in making strategic data-driven decisions by the marketing team, finance team, and technical team of Airbnb.
